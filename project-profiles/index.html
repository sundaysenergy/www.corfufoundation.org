						<p><strong>Below are profiles of initiatives supported by the Corfu Foundation.</strong></p>
<h3>Increasing Understanding of American Indian Communities</h3>
<p>Grant support will enable the Center for American Indian Research and Native Studies (CAIRNS) to further its mission to advance knowledge and understanding of American Indian communities and issues important to them. Specifically, funding will be used to complete the Center&#8217;s resource and educational library, to pursue its status as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, and to publish a handbook on <em>South Dakota Tribes and Reservations</em>, enabling educators to create accurate, culturally-rich classroom curriculums.<br />
Grant award: $15,000</p>
<h3>Empowering Youth to be Leaders of Social Change</h3>
<p>Youth in Lebanon &#8212; as in every country &#8212; have powerful ideas for contributing to their communities yet often lack the skills and resources to do so. Through its Aie Power program, Aie Serve, a youth-led nongovernmental organization, will select three youth teams to receive training, coaching, and financial support to lead projects in the areas of health, the environment, youth development, volunteerism, and more.<br />
Grant award: $10,000</p>
<h3>Integrating Mindfulness Education into Schools</h3>
<p>The documentary film, <a href="http://www.roomtobreathefilm.com"><em>Room to Breathe</em></a>, demonstrates how mindfulness instruction can help schools combat disciplinary problems, bullying, and violence, while improving academic performance among students. Funding will support the launch of the film&#8217;s national outreach and engagement campaign designed to spark dialogue on how to better integrate mindfulness into schools.<br />
Grant award: $5,000</p>
<h3>Raising Awareness of the Impact of Chemicals on Human Health</h3>
<p>Funding will support the post-production and distribution of <a href="http://thehumanexperimentmovie.com"><em>The Human Experiment</em></a>, a feature documentary film chronicling efforts to protect citizens from the thousands of untested chemicals in everyday products. The film seeks to focus national attention on this underexposed environmental and public health crisis and to drive social and political change.<br />
Grant award: $10,000</p>
<h3>Encouraging Understanding of Death as a Part of Life</h3>
<p>Can a deeper understanding of death inform how we live our lives? A grant to the Institute for Noetic Sciences is being used to support the post-production and distribution of <em>Death Makes Life Possible</em>, a feature documentary film aimed at sparking dialogue around what is often a taboo subject. Through consulting scientists, mental health experts, and wisdom traditions through the ages, the film makes the case that we have much to gain by facing our fear of death and asking what death might have to offer our lives.<br />
Grant award: $15,000</p>
<h3>Exploring the Meaning of the Mayan 2012 Prophecies Through Art</h3>
<p>Funding will support the American Visionary Arts Museum&#8217;s ALL THINGS ROUND&#8221; exhibit that will honor cyclical notions of time and explore the Mayan calendar prophecies, with the goal of increasing understanding and dialogue around this widely-publicized phenomenon. A related conference featuring indigenous artists and environmental scholars will spotlight their views about the significance of this critical period of human and planetary evolution, and the need to fundamentally realign humanity&#8217;s relationship with the Earth.<br />
Grant award: $10,000</p>
<h3>Improving Health and Nutrition in Schools</h3>
<p>Grant support will fund the production of a documentary <a href="http://www.corfufoundation.org/project-profiles/www.cafeteriaman.com">film</a> chronicling efforts to ensure that Baltimore City&#8217;s 83,000 public school students are fed healthy, nutritious, locally grown meals. The film seeks to educate audiences about positive efforts being undertaken to green the public school diet, to encourage dialogue around effective strategies, and contribute to policy reform.<br />
Grant award: $25,000</p>
<h3>Surveying Youth Engagement in Civic Life</h3>
<p>What issues and forms of engagement will drive the Millennial generation to participate in American governance beyond the 2008 election? Support was provided to Mobilize.org to conduct the second annual Democracy 2.0 Survey of 16- to 30-year-olds about their level of engagement in volunteer activities and civic organizations. Special attention was placed on youth views and priorities in light of the global economic crisis.<br />
Grant award: $5,000</p>
<h3>Developing Renewable, Clean Energy Alternatives</h3>
<p>The Trees for Clean Energy Network (TCEN), a nongovernmental organization in Kenya, seeks to boost rural farm incomes through the cultivation of Jatropha curcas, a clean energy biofuel. Grant support will enable TCEN&#8217;s Executive Director to participate in the 2008 Washington International Renewable Energy Conference and network with organizations focused on developing alternative energy solutions.<br />
Grant award: $3,000</p>
<h3>Connecting Native American Youth to Their Roots and Their Futures</h3>
<p>Launched in 2006, Can Wigmunke is a holistic environmental education organization serving Native American children and youth on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Its goal: to empower young people to become better stewards of their natural world. Support will be used for the creation of community gardens, farmer&#8217;s markets, outdoor science projects, and application for non-profit status as a 501(c)3.<br />
Grant award: $10,000</p>
<h3>Promoting Youth Leadership on Social and Political Issues</h3>
<p>Founded in 2002, Mobilize.org is an all-partisan organization dedicated to educating, empowering, and energizing young people in the U.S. to increase their civic engagement and political participation. Support from the Corfu Foundation is being used to ensure that the youth voice is amplified and addressed during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election. Funds will support two conferences, including the Party for the Presidency, a four-day youth leadership conference to be held prior to the presidential primary.<br />
Grant award: $10,000</p>
<h3>Teaching Meditative Intelligence in Schools</h3>
<p>Evaluation data from a 2005 pilot project conducted by the Goldie Hawn Institute found that teaching meditative intelligence to children resulted in decreases in negative and depressive thinking, and increases in a child&#8217;s self-concept and optimism. Funding from the Corfu Foundation is being used by the Goldie Hawn Institute to support the adaptation of its approach to classrooms in the United States, including teacher training and the development of resource materials.<br />
Grant award: $12,500</p>
<h3>Promoting Whole Person Healing Traditions</h3>
<p>In April 2005, the Corfu Foundation was among the co-sponsors of the Whole Person Healing Summit organized by the Campaign for Better Health, a grassroots action network dedicated to bringing national attention to integrative health and wellness practices. The Summit brought together top Ayurvedic scientists, Qi Gong masters, spiritual health researchers, and expert physical scientists, enabling each to contribute to a greater understanding of one another&#8217;s healing traditions and practices, while furthering collaboration among participants.<br />
Grant award: $5,000</p>
